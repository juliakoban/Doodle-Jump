## Description 
This project is a clone of the popular game Doodle Jump build with C++ and SFML. It was developed with the primary goal of learning and practicing Object-Oriented Programming principles and design patterns.

Future development plans include the integration of additional features, such as defeating monsters and incorporating a jetpack mechanism.
